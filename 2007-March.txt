Subject: [Sax-users] Help with fglrx!!!
Message-ID: <1174352930.13846.5.camel@linux-9vu9.site>

half baked into linux, I use opensuse with a Dell Latitude C610 laptop.
Radeon manage to give me 3D to my ATI Mobility LY video card, but I'm
unable to set fglrx ! I trid many things, back and forth, and it still
won't pick.

1?) Does it have too? I mean, I get 3D working after all

2?) If it have too, how to set it up? Will I have to recompile my
kernel, etc...

3?) After seting up fglrx,  and then running X, it tells me "no device
found", and I have to go back to radeon.

4?) Someone wants to loose time with a newby to explain what I have to
do, if anything?

Tks!

According my experience -- not very big --, (first Radeon 7200, than
Radeon 9250 SE on desktop (openSUSE 10.0 i586), Radeon Mobility 9600
in notebook (openSUSE 10.2 i586)):

=1= ATI proprietary driver (fglrx) must be selected only if something
is not covered by (radeon) open-source driver. In my case everything
was smooth w. (radeon), excepting missing TV-Out support (for the
desktop) and 3D/OpenGL (on notebook - for this new Compiz 3D window
manager, has not worked w. (radeon)). Since in your setup you have 3D
already w. (radeon) - then hopefully (fglrx) setup is not necessary
for you.

=2= It's a tricky task, i have googled for manuals/how-to's and tried
several of them before it has worked. As i can remember, after initial
generating w. (SaX) i'm ended up w. practically hand-written
/etc/X11/xorg.conf (unfortunately w/o deep understanding - just taking
this and that from various examples).

=3= Try to start w. examining /var/log/Xorg.0.log - what is exact
messages there ? How does you do switching (radeon)/(fglrx) - tweaking
/etc/X11/xorg.conf ? Using SaX (don't know if it really possible) ?
