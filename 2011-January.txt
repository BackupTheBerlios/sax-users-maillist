Subject: [Sax-users] troubles with external monitor: Samsung 22''
Message-ID: <1294649315.8148.6.camel@mylap.myhome>

Hello,

I am trying to get my external monitor worning and the results are not
quite satisfactory. It works somehow, but everything painted on the
screen has a "shadow". There are no settings available to experiment
with in GUI gnome-display-properties for the resolution I want to use
(1680x1050), just 60Hz.

Looking in /var/log/Xorg.0.log, I see
(II) intel(0): EDID vendor "SAM", prod id 596
(II) intel(0):     EDID quirk: Detailed timing is not preferred, use
largest mode at 60Hz

and the config file /etc/X11/xorg.conf asks me not to edit the file
"Automatically generated by [ISaX] (8.1)".

I'd be grateful for any help you can offer with this. The monitor works
just fine on Windows.

Many thanks,
Petr
