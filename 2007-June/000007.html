<PRE>I'm running SLES10 SP1 with a Dell E207WFP monitor. When I open YaST and click on Graphics Card and Monitor I find a default resolution of 1024x768 (XGA) with Colors at 16 bit. SaX2 reports my monitor as a DEL DELL E207 WFP. First off I find it odd that my Monitor shows up under DEL instead of DELL, but it at least gets the Sync Frequencies correct.

The major issue is this:
When I try to change the resolution of the monitor it takes me through the whole processes of Testing, Saving, and you will need to restart X before the changes take effect. Incidentally, when I test the configuration it says Screen [0]: 1024x768 @60 Khz : 76 Hz. But I can completely reboot the machine and nothing changes. 

I tried running sax2 from the command line. I get the following set of messages:
SaX: initializing please wait...
SaX: you current configuration will not be read in 

SaX: access to you display is denied. 

SaX: startup

And then it takes me into the usual graphical interface.

I'm particularly confused about the denial of access to my display. I'm root when I do these commands. I ran strace with it and found the /usr/sbin/sax.sh file. From there I was able to trace the output down to the configuration message. It then seems to jump to the startup message. Unless the...

$INIT $IN_OPT --quiet no 

...line is generating it. 

I can get it to grant me access if I'm graphically logged in and have YaST open, in which case SaX2 opens in my graphical console.. But I still can't get it to change the resolution.
Setting the Monitor as a generic LCD doesn't help. Setting it as VESA doesn't help. Going into /etc/X11/xorg.conf and deleting or commenting out the lower resolutions doesn't help. 

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.
