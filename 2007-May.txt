s-video cable...I got double screen, but the output on the tv is out of
sinc...I tried to configure it myself, but lo and alas, I CAN'T...my video
card is mobility M6, it doesn't work with ati prorietary drivers, but does
fine with 3d with radeon...Atitvout tells me that CRT is attached, I don't
know how to install GATOS, nor do I know what to put in my
xorg.conffile...Soemone helps me?
