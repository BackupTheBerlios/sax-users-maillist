Subject: [Sax-users] xrandr doesn't show modes?
Message-ID: <FEE984D73FF17F47BBD071551E82FD6339B68D@pgsv-data-1.parsec.local>

OK, to be honest, I'm not sure this is a sax problem, but I ran into this list while heading in to modify my xorg.conf like every article I found said to...

I'm using SUSE 10.1.  I have a widescreen laptop (DV8000 w/NVIDIA).  It supports all the widescreen modes.  They are (or were) listed in xorg.conf as modes and even in the modeline, but they're NOT accessible from the SUSE resapplet or from xrandr or from <CTRL><ALT><KP+|->.  Why?  Where's the old sax tab where I got to choose the modes I wanted to use and not use?
