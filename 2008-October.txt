Subject: [Sax-users] nvidia quadro 290 resolutions not detected with sax2 on
	openSuSE 11.0
Message-ID: <ac1e627c0810220822p5560f2e7qd2fcde7aeacd1e4f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am running opensuse 11.0 on several computers and I'm using sax2 to
automatically configure xorg.conf (sax --auto -r)
Up to now it managed to automatically detect video card resolutions with no
problem, but with the nvidia quadro nvs 290 it only detects 800x600, even
though both the card and screen can go much higher.
Manually configuring xorg.conf works fine, but I need the auto detect
because I am deploying an app on many computers and do not know ahead of
time what hardware configuration the computers have.

I am using the binary nvidia driver.
Am I missing something?
